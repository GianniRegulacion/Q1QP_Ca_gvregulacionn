        <h2><strong>INTRODUCTORY</strong></h2> 
        <br>
            <h6><i> EA FC 24 is a football video game where players collect football players, play them in matches, or sell them for the game’s in-game currency called FIFA Coins. Our project aims to find the best football player in the shooting trait from different teams and positions. The variables include the footballers’ teams, field positions, shooting skills, and overall capability. These are their qualities and measured capabilities in different roles in football. We chose a sample of 50 random characters from different teams in the Premier League. Their character profile can be easily searched for, so we picked a reliable source to use for our project.

            <h3><strong>CONTEXT</strong></h3>
            <li>
                Who: 50 football players from different clubs of the Premier League
            </li>
            <li>
                What: The 50 random football players’ capabilities / The Premier League - the highest and the best English football league system
            </li>
            <li>
                Where: England
            </li>
            <li>
                When: Seasons typically run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches against all other teams
            </li>

                When: Seasons typically run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches against all other teams
            </li>
            <li>
                How: By collecting the data of these random players from its official website: ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc
            </li> <br>
            <h2><strong>EXPERIMENTAL UNIT:</strong></h2> 
            <h6>This dataset is a SAMPLE. It is a sample mainly because we picked only random players, and not the whole league, which consists of roughly about 500+ members.
                <li>
                    Sample size is 50, the total number of players we randomly chose.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Target population: EA Sports FC 24 players or enthusiasts
                </li>
                 <li>
                    Sampling method: We asked Google to generate a random number from 1 to 5, and that will be the number of players we will pick from a team on the list one of our members has, until the number of players adds up to at least 50 individuals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Qualitative variables are the players’ teams and their field position (field position is their role + where they’re located on the field).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Quantitative variables are the players’ overall capabilities and how powerful their shooting is.
                </li>
